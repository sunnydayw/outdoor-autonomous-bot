Idnetified few issue on the pi3-rover-1/dashboard code. the teleop.html dashboard need few improvement
- for Telemetry from Pico. the section need little more thought out design, using consider looking at skill from .ai/skills/frontend-design and redesign. the IMU information, voltage, status and RPM should be separate and carefully design for easy out while operating the robot.
- for the Telemetry from Pico, once the pico is disconnected, the webpage doesnt seem to update the status right away. the status will still shows last update 0.1 seconds ago. and it shows disconnected later when i refresh the page. this should be fix such that when pico go offline, the status should show disconnected, and maybe give a time to last connected.
- The battery level should have its own section. it is a 2550mAH 12V 3s1p battery pack, indivual cell had max voltage of 4.2 volt and minmum of 2.5v, however typically we dont want to discharge under 3.0 volts. so i would set the 9 volt as the 0% and 12.5 volt as 100%
the raw reading is from a ADC pin for reading battery voltage via 1:11 voltage divider
