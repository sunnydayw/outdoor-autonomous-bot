here are three issue im look to resolve:
- when disconnect battery, the battery level drop to 0%, but imu and RPM was display as the last recived number. I think use the last received number is a better option, please update the battery infomration to do the same.

- Please update Command Mapping (v, ω), using skill from .ai/skills/frontend-design and redesign.

- when reconnecting pico from pi got this warning message, please look into pi-pico communication spec and identify if this is a issue, is so reslove it.
