I notices sometime there will be a delay (few seconds) between when i move the stick to when the motor is rotating, it only happne few times, feel like the motor responds is lagging my joystick control. for example i did a combination of direction change on the stick and few second later the motor move in that pattern. what could be the cause of this issue and how to fix it?
