Command Mapping section improving need some improving:
- lets start with remove unuseful information, such as the Axes section
- the raw input and normalized could ben combine into one to maximze display real estate. I do like the the way command output have the two side by side. maybe mimic it for FWD and STR.
- lets add a section allow me to change the limit for the linear and angular velocity. becuase I have to have some room to test the actual max speed. the current max speed was a estiimate and act more like a safety in place. in addtion.
