Two independent motor controllers (your existing Motor class) that already run closed-loop PID (or set_rpm_async) control.
A new higher-level “diff drive” controller that:
Accepts ROS‐formatted cmd_vel commands (linear and angular velocity).
Converts those commands into individual left and right wheel RPM setpoints using standard differential drive kinematics.
Continuously commands the motors to reach the desired speeds.
Implements a cmd_vel timeout: if no new command is received within a given period, it stops the motors for safety.
