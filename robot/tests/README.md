Notes:

These values are based on open-loop control, where the motor is directly driven at a specified power percentage.
The RPM was measured using an encoder and averaged over a 5-second sampling period at each power level.
The motor's behavior may vary slightly due to load conditions, mechanical resistance, and electrical factors.
